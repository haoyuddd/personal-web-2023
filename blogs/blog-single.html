                    <time class="published" datetime="2015-11-01">November 1, 2015</time>

                    <p>This idea of organising a Chinese calligraphy workshop has been in my mind for a really long time. This year I finally did it and I got really positive feedback!
                    </p>
                    <p> My grandfather and my mother both writing Chinese Calligraphy as hobby. I also started writing Chinese Calligraphy since I was six, it has been part of my life. Therefore, I really appreciate people who sharing this passion with me.
                        I didn't expect that all my participants mentioned that writing Chinese Calligraphy makes them calm down and focus inner selves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since I started studying in the Netherlands, the international environment really inspired me and broaden my vision. Nevertheless, I sometimes feel some gap between my friends and my Chinese culture. It's not because people are not willing to learn, it's
                        because these is no opportunity. Chinese culture, as one of the most ancient culture in the world, is unique and different, which makes it harder to approach and understand. This is the main reason why I am doing this workshop
                        - I am the culture ambassador!
                    </p>
                    <p>A lot of thanks to my dearest friends who support me! I will do more sessions in the future. Please let me know, if you are interested! </p>
