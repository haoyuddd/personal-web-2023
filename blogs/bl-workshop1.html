                <p>The November in 2019, I organized the first calligraphy workshop in the Netherlands.
                    <br> I've been thinking about doing a calligraphy workshop abroad for a while now. I occasionally posted photos of my calligraphy on Instagram and put some calligraphy works on my portfolio website, so I often had friends asking about
                    it. A group of friends around me who were very interested in world culture would often come for conversation and say that they would love to try it for themselves.
                    <br> Besides, since coming abroad in 2018 I was struck by how little most of my friends actually know about China and Chinese culture, even in the 21st century world. Of course, I don't exclude those who might not be interested in,
                    but I have met many people who are keen but have no access to start. They have never had the opportunity to go to China, and rarely even have the chance to interact with their Chinese classmates in depth. Whether it is because of cultural
                    differences or different political systems, China is always a mystery to many people. China is such a big country, yet it is so inaccessible to the foreign world.
                    <br>I have always believed that nowadays China is slowly coming onto the stage of history, we should not only pay attention to the export of technology and capital, but also take advantage of the wind to develop cultural exchanges,
                    so that more people have the opportunity to understand our philosophy of life.
                    <br>So, with the strong support and encouragement of my dear friends, I finally got my wish and held my first calligraphy workshop. However, I wasn't sure how to teach people, who don't know Chinese at all, to write Chinese characters.
                    Let alone how to interpret the wonders of Chinese calligraphy. During my prep time, I realized I didn't even know how to translate some of the vocabulary, don't mention how to translate the ancient poems. I wanted this workshop to
                    be a little dry knowledge, but also interesting and not boring; therefore, this workshop was a pilot test to collect feedback, and I invited all my friends who know each other well. Because I had this idea for a long time, I bought
                    some brushes, ink, rice paper, ink plates, plus my own ink stone, paperweight and other small objects for the presentation when I returned to China last summer. Unfortunately, I came to Holland with only a red resin seal engraved by
                    machine, which was a bit lacking in sophistication. However, because this seal was given to me by my grandfather when I first learned Chinese painting at the age of five or six, I did not feel inferior and kept it. As for the character
                    posters, I only have a book of small regular script in Holland, however the brushes I bought are too big and don't seem to fit well. My selfish intention, of course, is to let everyone write
                    <Lanting Preface>, however, I really don't like the English translation version I found on the Internet, and I just feel that it has lost its rhythm and is slightly astringent. Therefore, I put more effort into giving the foreign students Chinese names
                        and using a calligraphy dictionary to collect everyone's names in regular script, running script and seal script. I thought it might be a little more interesting to show the three scripts and attach a personal touch to it. I was
                        particularly worried that those who did not know Chinese would be limited in their exposure to calligraphy and would have difficulty understanding the essence of the art. My personal understanding of calligraphy is that it is a
                        complex art. First, it encompasses both the form and surface of the paper on which it is written, as well as the written text and poetry itself, and from both is conveyed the catharsis of the author's feelings at the time and the
                        environment of the times in which he or she lived. Second, the variety of fonts and schools of calligraphy is closely linked to the development of the Chinese characters themselves with the dynasties. Thus, the art of calligraphy
                        inevitably encompasses the complexity and artistry of the Chinese characters themselves. In the end, I decided to cover only the more general knowledge and introduced the tools of calligraphy, the classification of fonts, the characteristics
                        of Chinese character forms, the starting and finishing strokes, etc. through a PPT plus a display of things. In addition, I emphasized the following points: you can't trace to copy, you have to write slowly, and the key is not
                        the words you write, but the state of mind of writing. However, my anxiety later proved to be unnecessary. After playing some slightly Zen-like guzheng and guqin music, everyone went off to write. The whole process was much smoother
                        than I expected, and everyone was writing very carefully. Before I knew it, two hours had passed, and some of my friends said, "Time flies. And later, everyone mentioned that their minds were quieted while they were writing. They
                        did not dwell too much on the meaning of the words and translations that I was overly worried about, but they enjoyed the process of writing with their pens. Even just copying was found to be a very creative activity. One friend
                        found the brush to be a great source of concentration and fun, as it ensures that each stroke is different from the next. Another friend said it was like going through a long meditation session. For me, writing does help my restless
                        heart and thoughts to settle down slowly. Sometimes my wrists are sore from writing, but I don't feel it, and I am completely absorbed in the slow, focused state of the pen. I was amazed and relieved to hear my friends echoing
                        the same sentiment. I really did not expect that they would feel the peace that I value most in calligraphy. I truly believe that this is the magic of this ancient art! After the workshop, everyone expressed their gratitude to
                        me, collected their works, and left contentedly. I also expressed my gratitude to everyone and was satisfied to the utmost. Calligraphy, because of its artistic nature, connects us from all over the world. I introduced calligraphy
                        to others with a love for my own culture and history, and the so-called others accepted my culture with an open heart and a respect for the ancient civilization of mankind. The opposite is also true. This, I think, is the great
                        use of the uselessness of art. Art can evoke the purest and most beautiful consciousness in people's hearts, making us soft and approachable. I thought that if I kept doing this, maybe this kind of calligraphy workshop could connect
                        more different people together and become a bridge of cultural communication. When I thought of this, my whole being was jubilant at that time. Especially after sharing some photos on social media, many of my friends wrote me privately
                        that they also wanted to participate. This made me even more determined to continue the calligraphy workshop in the New Year. Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)
