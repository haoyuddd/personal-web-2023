                            <p> As the field of automated vehicles (AVs) advances, it has become increasingly critical to develop human-machine interfaces (HMI) for both internal and external communication. Critical dialogue is emerging around the potential
                                necessity for a holistic approach to HMI designs, which promotes the integration of both in-vehicle user and external road user perspectives. This approach aims to create a unified and coherent experience for different
                                stakeholders interacting with AVs. This workshop seeks to bring together designers, engineers, researchers, and other stakeholders to delve into relevant use cases, exploring the potential advantages and challenges of this
                                approach. The insights generated from this workshop aim to inform further design and research in the development of coherent HMIs for AVs, ultimately for more seamless integration of AVs into existing traffic.</p>

                                    <p>This was my first internship, which was especially meaningful for me. I got help and support from my supervisors, as well as appreciation and suggestions from Asia region managers.
                                        <br> I appreciate the opportunities to work on real client projects, and the experience provided me with clear view of how the industry works and what is the designer's role when working with external clients, and
                                        how to communicate and express our design ideas to people who don't have any design background.
                                        <br> I was able to attend the annual convention 2017 during my internship, which shows to me a new side of this team. Everyone was so proud of being a part of Faurecia, and everyone is willing to commit to the company
                                        as well.
