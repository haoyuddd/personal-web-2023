                            <p> In contemporary automotive contexts, the growing substitution of physical buttons with digital screens has resulted in a diminished level of sensory feedback associated with physical forms and materials, and rich interaction.
                                In response, this demonstration introduces shape-changing physical buttons that address this limitation. Building upon a material-oriented design exploration "Trycka", the buttons were created and seamlessly integrated
                                into the leather fabric of the car interior. These buttons possess temporal forms that enable multi-sensory (haptic and visual) interactive feedforward and feedback. As the development of automated vehicles and intelligent
                                systems progresses, these buttons serve as output compositions of the system, allowing expressivity in the interactions. By presenting experiential prototypes in this demonstration, we provide the automotive community an
                                opportunity to engage with and explore tactile sensations. This paper presents the explorative process of shape-changing buttons and the implications for the automotive industry.
