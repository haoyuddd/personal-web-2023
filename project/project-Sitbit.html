                        <h4>Solution</h4>
                        <p>The Sitbit system includes the sensor mat, wearable, user application, and therapists dashboard. The data from the sensor mat is collected and can be analyzed to create a personalized feedback system. In this project, we investigated
                            the intuitive design to provide reminders for wheelchair users with spinal cord injury, which could lead to a behavior change in a long-term run.

                            Being in a wheelchair is a visible handicap, the social pressure could reduce the intention, therefore the wearable should not be as a medical instrument that makes the users get further discriminated and deterioration. By this, we also add new meaning
                            we created is: it is a pleasurable accessory, which does not embarrass the users showing to people and can be a conversation starter. As the major factor influence behavioral intention, we add more “personal agency” to the
                            product, or so-called personal autonomy, which is one of the most important aspects derived from that empathy map.

                        In order to support the patient's long-term behavior change and fulfill their needs, , we decided to create a holistic solution to (1) remind the patients to change their sitting posture with subtle and instant feedbacks, (2) give overview of their own
                        progress, and (3) support the therapists to collect frequent data of their patients.
