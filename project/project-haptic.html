                    <p>How to support designers to create haptic symbols (a set of designed spatial-temporal vibrotactile patterns) that link to specific abstract information in Human-Computer Interaction? We got your back! In this study, I propose a design
                        tool for the initial exploration and iteration of vibrotactile patterns as a new interaction modality and provide a stepping stone for further research in haptic interaction design.

                    <H3>User Study and Expert Evaluation</H3>
                    <P>In this section, I briefly summarize the evaluation, including usability test, expert evaluation and data analysis. More detailed information can be found in the report. User Study: Distinguishability of the patterns: accessed by the
                        recognition rate Affordance: measured by the mapping rate with the information items Subjective workload and user experience: rated through a Likert Scale questionnaire modified from the UEQ questionnaire. The participants were
                        encouraged to think aloud and speak. A semi-structured interview was conducted at the end of the session. The notes were informally analyzed based on the content analysis method.</P>
                    <P>Expert Evaluation The aim of the expert evaluation is not limited to the design concept itself, but also gathering feedback about the application and further development. Five experts were recruited from Manus VR, three wearable designers
                        (one lead director, one for generating concepts, one for bringing concept to prototype), one industrial designer and one lead director focusing on wearable hardware engineer. The expert evaluation was conducted in the office of
                        Manus VR in Eindhoven. The interview notes were analysed by content analysis tools.</P>
