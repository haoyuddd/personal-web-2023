                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>With the development of automated driving technology, let's envision in the near future that we are able to enjoy other activities in automated vehicles (AV). However, general public still have concerns about AV driving in everyday
                        traffic and recent research shows that acceptance of AV drops as the level of automation increases.
                        <br> Consider a scenario in which the driver is check his phone in AV and his attention is diverted from the road. Conseqently, if the AV brakes suddenly due to a front car slowing down, the driver may be caught off guard and experiences
                        a negative surprise (automation surprise, AS). This causes discomfort and hindering the driver to enjoy his ride fully.

                    <h3>Research Goal</h3>
                    <p>Through literature research and a concept-driven design process, we created a haptic-based anticipatory cue, that prompts the user to glance or scan around to acquire potential information in the real-world environment, therefore mitigating
                        AS. We proposed this design concept based on previous concepts and theoretical guidance of calm technology and peripheral interaction. As during automated driving, the information involved may not be safety-related or time-critical
                        and the interactions may afford to happen mostly in the periphery of the user's attention.
                        <br> Our process involved creating hypothetical interaciton diagram, developing lo-fidelity prototype, established a Wizard of Oz environment to observe how people experience the prototype. Insights from research led to proposing
                        further ressearch agenda and desing iteration for high-fidelity prototypes.

                                <p>The <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/wizard-of-oz/#:~:text=Definition%3A%20The%20Wizard%20of%20Oz,Norman%20at%20UC%20San%20Diego." target="_blank">Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ)</a> vehicle used in this study possessed by
                                    the Department of Industrial Design, Eindhoven University of Technology. It is a modified Renault Espace 2.0 and was initially designed and used in the studies by Dr. Juffrizal Karjanto and Dr. Nidzamuddin Yusof during
                                    their Ph.D. project (2018), investigating motion sickness in fully automated vehicles (SAE Level 5).
                                </p>
                                <p>The original setup of the WoZ vehicle does not provide the experimental setup of level 3 to level 5 AVs, as the main focus of this study. Therefore, we modified the interior by adding a fake dashboard, steering wheel and
                                    pedals.
                                </p>

                                <h3>WoZ Technique</h3>
                                <p>The WoZ technique aims to provide approachable and physical experience of not-yet-existing technologies, in this case, the feeling of sitting in the driver's seat of an AV.. The human driver drives the WoZ vehicle (wizard
                                    driver) was seated in the normal driver's seat. The back row of seats was used for the participants. A partition (6) was installed to ensure the wizard driver is invisible to the participants. A TV screen (7) was mounted
                                    to the partition, which is connected to a camera (3) mounted on the windshield, which could capture the front view. When sitting in the back seat, the participants could view the frontal view of the car in real time
                                    through the TV screen. </p>

                    <h3>Methodology: Research through Design</h3>
                    <p>Throughout this study, we employed the <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/research-through-design" target="_blank">research-through-design (RtD)</a> approach
                        due to its reflective nature, which allows for the continuous interpretation and framing of a given situation. This approach involves a process of making and critiquing artifacts that function as proposed solutions.
                        <!-- ~\cite{TheAction1983Schon} -->
                        By creating tangile artifacts and conducting on-road qualitative study employing a WoZ vehicle, I explore the non-critical automated driving experience and gain insight into the iteration of non-intrusive interaction design.
