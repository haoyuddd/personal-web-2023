                                <p>Based on my Personal Development Plan of my Master's study, I would like to develop my skills in designing for multiple stakeholders and developing business models to solve complex industrial issues. Therefore, I decided
                                    to join Accenture's Industry X.0 team to cooperate on a project. During this internship, I attempted to combine design thinking with a business consulting mind, to further understand my role as a designer in the current
                                    industry. I improved both my professional skills as a versatile designer and soft skills as a team player.

                    <p>
                        I started this project built on Accenture Industry X.0 vision, with a focus on improving the working experience of the construction workers by exploring the potential application and combination of cutting edge technologies. ​ The project converged from
                        two aspects: 1) Design & Research: Research through Design methodology was adopted (Koskinen, et al., 2011) and a prototype was built and used for usability evaluation. In turn, the results of the evaluation promote the development
                        of the business model. 2) Business Modeling: the business model canvas was used, and the project was considered as a start-up group within Accenture Industry X.0. ​ Accenture Industry X.0 shows interest in taking the project for
                        further development, potentially with a construction company and a hardware creator to provide a new idea or initiative. ​ Due to the Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality Agreement, I will not be able to disclose my work. If you
                        are interested in the scope of connected workers and the working culture at Accenture, please feel free to contact me.

                    <p>This project mainly contributes to my business mindset as a multidisciplinary designer. The mindset shifting from pure user-centered design to integrating the business design method equips me with the working ability to solve complex
                        issues in real work situations. The process is shown in the following figure.

                        <h4>The Takeaways</h4>
                        <p>The journey in Accenture is not limited to my own project, but a whole new working experience for in this international company and multidisciplinary team.
                            <br></br> We are a big family! I sincerely appreciate the working vibe in Accenture, especially in the Industry X.0 team based in Inspiration Center Eindhoven. When I just started my internship, I was encouraged to connect
                            with all the people in the team, not only interns but also the senior consultants and managers, who are all willing to show supports and provide help if needed. I admire the equality, which I believe, could make everyone feel
                            welcomed and more willing to commit to their job.
                            <br></br> Find my position to assist the team As a design student, it was hard for me to figure out what I can do in this consulting company. I was enthusiastic to help but I was not confident and certain enough. With the help
                            and support from the team, I started to take ownership and assist the team with my strength. For example, I assisted in the demonstration presentation event organization in the Inspiration Center in Eindhoven. I also was responsible
                            for branding design with my design skills.
                            <br></br> Missed opportunities I would like to highlight the struggle and miss the opportunities I had in this internship. At the early stage of the project, it was hard for me to find a balance between business value and user-centered
                            design. I was too focused on the value of Accenture and overlooked the design process. Another challenge was getting contact with target users in the Netherlands, due to the cultural difference and language barriers. </p>
